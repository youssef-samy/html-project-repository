<p style="font-size:120%">*While the term computer architecture sounds very complex, it is easier to describe than one would expect. Computer architecture is a science or a collection of rules that describe how computer software and hardware are combined and communicate to make a machine work together. It defines not only how the computer functions but also which computer technologies are capable of.Computers continue to be a major part of our lives, and computer architects continue to create new and better technology and programs.Computer architecture, Digital computer's internal structure, encompassing the nature and layout of its instruction set and data registers. A computer's architecture is chosen for the types of programs to be run on it (business , science, general-purpose, etc.). Its principal components or subsystems, each of which has its own architecture,Are input / output, storage , communication, transmission, and power.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">*Computer architecture is a specification which describes how hardware and software technologies interact to create a platform or system of computers. If we think of the word architecture, we think about the design of a house or a building. With the same idea in mind, computer architecture requires designing a Computer and everything that goes into a computer system.Computer architecture consists of three main categories.</p>
<ul>
 <li style="font-size:120%">System design: This involves all aspects of the hardware, such as CPU, data processors, multiprocessors, memory controllers, and direct memory. That element is the computer system itself.</li>
 <li style="font-size:120%">Instruction set architecture: This includes the functions and capabilities of the CPU, programming language of the CPU, data formats, types of processor registers, and instructions that computer programmers may use. This part is the software, such as Windows or Photoshop or similar programs, that makes it run.</li>
 <li style="font-size:120%">Microarchitecture: This defines the data processing and storage element or data paths and how they should be implemented into the instruction set architecture. These might include DVD storage devices or similar devices.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:120%">All these parts go together in a certain order and must be developed in a pattern so they will function correctly.</p>
