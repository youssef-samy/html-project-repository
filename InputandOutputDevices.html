<p style="font-size:120%">Input and output devices act as the user-computer interface. A device which sends information to a processing computer system is called an input device and a device which receives and then reproduces or shows the results of the processing is called an output device. Many devices are either input devices or output devices, as they can only accept user input data And forward the same to your computer device, or receive computer output data. There are certain devices that can accept both input and output handling, these device types are called as I / O devices (input / output devices). Peripherals are also called input-output devices. We 're going to discuss some information about different input output devices.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%"><b>Input Devices</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-Input devices can send data or information to a computer or another device.</p><p style="font-size:120%">-Input devices cannot receive data or signal from some other devices.</p><p style="font-size:120%">Various input devices are as listed below:</p>

<ol>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Keyboard:</b> It is an input device which sends data in to the computer. The data send depends on the key pressed by the user.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Mouse:</b>A mouse is a small handheld input device which controls a cursor in a graphical user interface. It can move and select text, files, folders etc. on our computer according to the user input.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Scanner:</b>Optically, the scanner reads and documents, files or images, then transforms them into digital signals, and sends them to the computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Webcam:</b>it sends the captured images to a computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Microphone:</b>it receives audio generated by some input source and sends the same to a computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Barcode reader:</b>It is used to read the barcode of various items and feed the same to computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>OMR:</b>optical mark recognition/ reader, is used to read marks on a document and send them to computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>MICR:</b>Magnetic Ink Character Reader is an input device which generally finds application is banks to process cheques.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Joystick:</b>these input devices are used to control video games.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>OCR:</b>OCR stands for optical character Recognition, is an input device which reads printed text and sends that to computer.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Trackballs:</b>trackball is an upside down mouse which is encased within a socket. It is a cursor control device.</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size:160%"><b>Output Devices</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%">A device capable of receiving data from a computer or other system and generating output with that data is called the output unit. Examples of various output devices are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Monitor:</b>A monitor is an output device that is responsible for receiving data from a computer and displaying that information as text or images for users to see on a screen.</li>
  <p style="font-size:140%"><b>Types of Monitors</b></p>
    <ul>
	 <center><img src="https://www.ipsmonitor.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/crt-vs-lcd-vs-ips-monitors.png" alt="Types of Monitors" width="600" height="200"/></center>
	 <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Cathode-ray tube (CRT):</b>use picture tube technology; inexpensive, but they take up desk space and use a lot of energy.</li>
     <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD or flat-panel):</b>Cells sandwiched between two transparent layers form images; expensive, and they take up less desk space and use less energy than CRT monitors.</li> 
     <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Light-emitting diode (LED):</b>is more energy-efficient and has better color accuracy and thinner panels than LCD monitors.</li>
    </ul>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Speakers:</b>Receives sound signal from a computer and then plays that sound signal and thus we hear songs or music or any other audio.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Projector:</b>Gets data from a computer and displays or projects the same information onto a screen or a wall. Projector cannot directly accept data from a user and send that data to another device.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Plotter:</b>is a printer that uses a pen that moves over a large revolving sheet of paper,It is used in engineering and map making.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Printers:</b>is a peripheral device that produces a physical copy or hard copy of the computer's output.</li>
  <p style="font-size:140%"><b>Two basic types:</b></p>
	 <center><img src="https://www.chtips.com/images/Printer-Types-of-Printer.jpg" alt="Types of Printer" width="400" height="300"/></center>
	<ul>
	 <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Impact printer:</b>is a printer that has a print head that contacts the paper to produce a character,It uses ink ribbon,It is noisy, produces Near-letter quality printouts, and is not commonly used today.from it's types:Dot-matrixâ€“ Pins are used to make characters. </li>
     <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Nonimpact printer:</b></li> 
	 <p style="font-size:140%"><b>Two types of nonimpact printers:</b></p>
     <ul>
	  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Laser printer:</b>use laser beams and static electricity to deliver toner onto the correct areas of the page. Heat fuses the toner to the page.</li>
	  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Inkjet printer:</b>are affordable and produce high-quality color printouts quickly and quietly. They spray tiny drops of ink onto paper.</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p style="font-size:160%"><b>Both Input / Output Devices</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%">An input/output device may receive data from users or other devices, and send data to other devices or computers as well. That means a devices which can be used as both input device and output device are called Input / Output (I/O) devices.Few examples of devices input / output are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Touch Screen:</b>Touch screen is both input and output device. By touching the screen input is provided and being a screen, it is used as an output device.</li>
    <li style="font-size:120%"><b>USB drive:</b>Often known as pen drive or flash stick , it functions both as a computer-input tool and as a tool for output. USB drives accept or save data as an input from a computer, and may also transfer data to a computer or another device.</li>
    <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Headsets:</b>Headset consists of speaker as an output device and microphone functions as an input device.</li>
	<li style="font-size:120%"><b>CD-RW drives and DVD-RW drives:</b>Receives data from a device as an input for copying to a writable CD or DVD and saving to that. We do use CDs or DVDs for the data transfer to a computer.</li>
    <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Modems:</b>It is used to transmit and receive data via telephone lines from one computer to another computer or to other devices.</li>
    <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Facsimile:</b>Facsimile or FAX machine requires a scanner to provide data and is an input tool and a small printer.</li>
