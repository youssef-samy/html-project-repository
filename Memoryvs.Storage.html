<p style="font-size:160%"><b>What Is Memory</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-Memory, as the link between your computer's central processing unit ( CPU) and data, is the most important component of a computing system.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-Memory consists of main memory and cache.</p>
<b><big>The main memory includes two types: </big></b>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size:120%">RAM (Random Access Memory)is volatile memory.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">ROM (Read Only Memory) is non-volatile memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<p style="font-size:130%"><b>*RAM</b></p>
  <li style="font-size:120%">RAM is also called primary memory, which exchanges data with theCPU directly.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">RAM is volatile. The data stored in the RAM will not stay when you shut down your computer. When you need to store such data as words and images, you need to save it in a long-term storage unit, like a hard drive.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">It can be read and written anytime with a high speed. Usually, it runs much faster than almost all access devices, and its access latency is negligible compared with other storage devices involving mechanical operation, such as hard disks and CD drives.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">RAM data comes from storage devices. If you want to access a file, it will be copied from storage devices and then you will be able to look at and edit it in the memory. If you don't save it again, the changes you've just made will be lost when the computer is shut off.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<p style="font-size:130%"><b>*ROM</b></p>
  <li style="font-size:120%">ROM is used to store software, sometimes known as firmware, which is rarely changed during system life.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Non-volatile memory (ROM) is read-only. The data stored in ROM, written by the memory system manufacture and then not modifiable, is stable and can not be lost except when the machine is turned off.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:160%"><b>What Is Storage</b></p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-Storage refers to the permanent holding place for digital data, which is also called the secondary storage.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-It is not accessible directly through the CPU. Usually the device uses its input / output channels to access secondary storage and transfer to main memory the desired data. Storage is a server that can hold data without power, and data can be stored indefinitely in storage devices until it is intentionally deleted.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-The secondary storage include internal hard drives and external storage devices like USB, CD, etc.</p>
<p style="font-size:120%">-The internal hard drives have two types: HDD and SSD.Nowadays, many users like to upgrade their internal hard drives to SSDs.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%"><b>Why is storage necessary?</b></p>
<p style="font-size:125%"><b>Storage:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Is cheaper than memory.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Plays an input role when starting applications.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Is needed for output.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Plays an important role during startup.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Devices can hold a large amount of data.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%">Retains data when the computer is turned off.</li>
</ul>
<center><p style="font-size:160%"><b>Capacity and Speed of Storage Devices</b></p></center>
   <p style="font-size:140%"><b>A storage device's performance is measured by:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Capacity:</b>The number of bytes of data that a device can hold.</li>
  <li style="font-size:120%"><b>Access Time:</b>The amount of time, in milliseconds (ms), it takes for the device to begin reading data.</li>
</ul>
