<p style="font-size:160%"><b>what is a computer?</b></p>
<p>A computer is an electronic device manipulating data, or information. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.This can be used to edit or create tablets, presentations and even images. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%"><b>Data Vs Information</b></p>
<ul>
   <li><b><big>Data:</big></b>is a representation of a fact, figure, or idea. Data can be a number, a word, a picture, or even a recording of sound.</li> 
   <li><b><big>Information:</big></b>is data that has been organized or presented in a meaningful fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:140%"><b>Hardware vs. software</b></p>
<ul>
<p>Before talking about different types of computers, let 's talk about two aspects that are common to all computers: hardware and software.</p>
   <li><b><big>Hardware:</big></b>is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all the internal parts of the computer which can be seen in the image below.</li>

   <li><b><big>Software:</big></b>is any set of instructions or data telling the hardware what to do and how to do it. This contrasts with the physical hardware from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Software examples include web-browsers, games, and word processors.Below is a Microsoft PowerPoint image which is used to construct presentations.</li>

</ul>

<p>Everything you do on your computer depends on both software and hardware. For example, if you see a lesson in a Web browser (software) and click from page to page using your mouse (hardware). When you read about various computer types, remind yourself about the variations in their hardware. When you step forward through this guide,You can note that different machine types also use different software styles too.</p>
<p style="font-size:140%"><b>Types of Computers</b></p>
<p>Computers come in many shapes and sizes and perform a number of different functions in our daily life. You are using a form of machine when you withdraw cash from an ATM, check grocery stores at the supermarket or use a calculator. Most people think of a personal computer like a desktop or a laptop when they hear the word computer. let us show different types of computers and some information about each of them.</p>

<p style="font-size:130%"><b>A.Stationary</b></p>
   <li><b><big>Desktop computers: </big></b> can be used at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they're typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse- Used in businesses that manage large amounts of data- A large, expensive computer that Separate case plus peripheral devices.</li>

   <li><b><big>Embedded: </big></b>Self-contained computer  devices performing dedicated functions- Specially designed computer chip that resides in another device.</li>

<p style="font-size:130%"><b>B.Portable</b></p>
   <li><b><big>Laptop computers: </big></b>commonly called a laptop.Laptops are computers powered by batteries that are more portable than desktops, with a keyboard, display and other devices  built into a single compact shell. Allowing you almost everywhere to use them.</li>

   <li><b><big>Tablet computers: </big></b>Tablet computers-or tablets are handheld computers that are even more portable than laptops. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, tablets use a touch-sensitive screen for typing and navigation. The iPad is an example of a tablet.</li>
